# Week of January 17, 2026

Things I learned during the week ending January 17, 2026.

- Distributed Key-value store -- https://etcd.io/

- Learnt about [VoiceLink](https://tryvoiceink.com/), an alternative to [Wispr Flow] that have been using as my STT software, with it's pricing model VoiceLink might be better replacement if it performs as good as WisprFlow

- The free-threaded version of python can be added to uv and github actions with `t` suffix. e.g. `3.14t` and `3.13t` [source](https://github.com/actions/setup-python?tab=readme-ov-file#basic-usage)

- Puzer published a [github recommendor](https://puzer.github.io/github_recommender/) that uses semantic embedding from user's github stars all client side, I found some great recommendations which I plan to use:
  - [pamburus/hl](https://github.com/pamburus/hl): A fast and powerful log viewer and processor that converts JSON logs or logfmt logs into a clear human-readable format. (⭐2657)
  - [samwho/spacer](https://github.com/samwho/spacer): CLI tool to insert spacers when command output stops (⭐1663)
