# Week of February 8, 2026

Things I learned during the week ending February 8, 2026.

- Opus 4.6 launch. 
  - context compaction (beta) and 1M context window, enables longer agentic tasks without loosing context. 
  - they claim it has found 500 Zero-Day Flaws in open-source projects (yet to see the proofs though) 
  - agent teams, multiple agent coordinates with a  leader agent.  https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams

- On blockchain, UIPC (Universal IPC) and SIPC (Secure IPC) are frameworks that allows different network to talk to each other using a standard protocol. While UIPC acts as the universal courier, SIPC acts as the security guard. Together, they create "Internet of Blockchains". [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app/b8339d20bf7f33cf) 

- [Vortex](https://vortex.dev/) a newer format is supported by [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/2026/01/23/duckdb-vortex-extension) promises to be faster for random access and has zero-copy metadata, with better compression. While the support across the board is limited but worth considering for LLM/RAG based uses over parquet. 

- **Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems** by Martin Kleppmann manages to be both rigorous technical manual and something approaching a philosophical treatise on the nature of truth, consistency, and trust in distributed systems.
