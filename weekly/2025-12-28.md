# Week of December 28, 2025

Things I learned during the week ending December 28, 2025.

- [how uv got so fast](https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/26/how-uv-got-so-fast.html). UV performance is because of design decisions while rust contributes to micro optimizations. 

- Notes from [Thoughtworks - Technology Radar vol 33](https://www.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/documents/radar/2025/11/tr_technology_radar_vol_33_en.pdf)
  - text-to-sql solutions aren't working as expected
  - pnpm, langGraph, and pydantic recommended for adoption

- [`npx -y npm-check-updates`](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates) tells you the latest versions of your `package.json`, ignoring pinned versions.

- [Inversion of Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) principle -- "Don't call us, we'll call you".
  - This design principle is used widely in Web Frameworks, GUI programs, etc in the form of event listeners, dependency injections, callbacks to avoid boilerplate code, resuability and testability.
  - Some popular examples are DOM, Flask, [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/providers), Angular, etc.
