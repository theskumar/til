# Week of January 11, 2026

Things I learned during the week ending January 11, 2026.

- Text based diagramming tools:
  - [Kroki](https://github.com/yuzutech/kroki) self-hosted solution for unified interface to buch of diagramming tools, including mermaid, d2, etc.
  - [d2](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2) provides a clean syntax and output as well.

- "[Django Postgres Migration Tools](https://github.com/kraken-tech/django-pg-migration-tools?tab=readme-ov-file) - add-on for safer and more scalable migrations in django.
