# Week of February 1, 2026

Things I learned during the week ending February 1, 2026.

- Notes on "How AI assistance impacts the formation of coding skills" [Article](https://www.anthropic.com/research/AI-assistance-coding-skills) [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46820924)
  - AI speeds up coding but reduces deep understanding and mastery
  - Juniors (1-3 years experience) showed speed improvements with AI, but 4+ year developers showed no difference
  - Modern software work is more about requirements, specs, documentation, and communication than raw coding skill
  - Small sample size (n<8) and study design limitations make results questionable
  - Takeaways:
    1. **Use AI for high-scoring interaction patterns**: Ask conceptual questions and request explanations rather than just code generation
    2. **Adopt AI for documentation and specs**: Multiple developers report dramatic improvements in tickets, PRs, and documentation quality
    3. **Be deliberate about learning**: If using AI, actively practice explaining concepts and avoid pure copy-paste workflows
    4. **Use AI to reduce grunt work**: Let it handle boilerplate, test writing, and repetitive tasks while focusing on architecture and requirements
  - **The research confirms what many suspected: AI coding assistants create a real trade-off between speed and skill development, but the practical significance is hotly contested.** The critical question isn't whether AI reduces learning (it does), but whether deep coding skill remains as valuable as expressing requirements clearly—and whether we're comfortable with a generation of developers who can't function without AI assistance.
