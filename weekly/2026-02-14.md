# Week of February 14, 2026

Things I learned during the week ending February 14, 2026.

- [zoocache](https://github.com/albertobadia/zoocache) is a sematic dependency based cache manager, that support in-memory, LMDB or redis backends. Integration with [Django](https://github.com/albertobadia/zoocache/blob/main/docs/django_user_guide.md) looks interesting.

- [Handy](https://handy.computer/) Looks like a promising tool for to replace WisperFlow and VoiceInk for speech to text conversion. [via](https://dannysmith.notion.site/Danny-s-Software-313c769fa9c04819a37d813da0485c78)

- [Hono](https://hono.dev/) based on web standards is a great option for js runtimes esp. if you plan to deploy your code to cloudflare workers, bun or deno. You get faster startup time and cross-platform compatibility.
