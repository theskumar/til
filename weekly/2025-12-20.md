# Week of December 20, 2025

Things I learned during the week ending December 20, 2025.

- New tools:
  - [gh-actions-lockfile](https://github.com/gjtorikian/gh-actions-lockfile) to generate and verify lockfiles for gh-actions
  - [Proxyman](https://proxyman.com/) is more user-friendly http debugging proxy than Charles Proxy on MacOS

- "Choose Boring Tech" by [Dan McKinley](https://boringtechnology.club/)
  - "The failure mode of boring tech are well-understood"

- Notes from ["Django rapid architecture"](https://www.django-rapid-architecture.org/)
  - Recommends organizing the codebase with interfaces at the top layer followed by readers and "actions", Finally, 'data' as the bottom layer to organize Django codebase to allow for a simple code structure that allows for scaling

- [VectorChord](https://github.com/tensorchord/VectorChord/) is a faster pgvector alternative.
